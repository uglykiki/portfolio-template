            Nasty Nets was a collaborative blog created to share media artifacts found while exploring the internet,
            along with
            original compositions and collages. The group, founded in 2006 and disbanded in 2012, was the first to
            popularize the
            term “surf club” to describe this type of online activity. The label was quickly adopted by other
            collectives with
            similar practices of collecting, juxtaposing, and curating found objects online.
